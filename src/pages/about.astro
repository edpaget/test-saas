        <p>
          FlowDesk was born in 2023 out of frustration. Our founders — a designer, an engineer, and a product manager — were
          tired of juggling five different tools just to keep their small team aligned.
        </p>
        <p>
          Existing project management tools were either too simple (sticky notes on a wall) or too complex
          (enterprise software that needed a consultant to set up). There had to be a middle ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          So they built FlowDesk: a tool that's powerful enough for complex projects but simple enough to start
          using on day one. No training required. No 50-page onboarding guide.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, FlowDesk is used by over 12,000 teams worldwide — from two-person startups to Fortune 500 companies.
          We're a fully remote team of 45 people spread across 12 countries, and we use FlowDesk every day to build FlowDesk.
